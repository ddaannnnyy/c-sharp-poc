# c-sharp-poc

Hello, sometimes I find myself in need of hacky, rapid proof of concepts.
My strongest OOP language is C#, so I usually throw them in here. Feel free to let me know if I could approached a problem a different way,
while my code may be inefficient, I am actively trying to learn.

<h2>Added: csvLineSkipper 13 Sep 2018 ===========================</h2><hr><br>
csvLineSkipper came about when I needed to merge the contents of two xls documents, which I really should have done in a db and then joined on FK and printed to a file,
however I wanted to get more familiar with list of arrays so I figured I would throw something together that would collect information in a relatively adaptive way from csv like files.

I would like to add more adaptability to the front end, so I can add it to a tool box while at work.
